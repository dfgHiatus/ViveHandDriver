# FullBodyTrackingVR

This project is a complete tracking of the body in order to be able to retransmit it in a virtual reality environment. 

This project was realized by a group of 4, divided in 2 pairs who worked on separate parts of the project that we then merged. 

A first part on the tracking of the user's hands via the helmet cameras, on which Bryan and Melchior mainly worked.
And a second part on the tracking of the body via a Kinect camera, mainly directed by Thomas and Josephine. 
Finally, we all worked together on the most important part of the development of the SteamVR driver.
